# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
As part of my MBA 1A coursework, my team and I worked on an Excel-based data analysis project for SVSC Credit Card Company. We handled a large dataset, applying pivot tables, slicers, and dashboards to extract key insights. Our project focused on visualizing trends, customer spending behavior, and performance metrics effectively. This was a group project with three of my peers, where we collaborated to ensure data accuracy and meaningful interpretations. The project enhanced our data handling, analytical, and visualization skills in Excel. We applied the concepts taught in our UNP classes, gaining practical exposure to business analytics. This experience strengthened our proficiency in Excel for real-world financial data analysis.
